# Scraper-Project
A simple webscraping project using the beautifulSoup library in Python. FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

The program takes the command line arguments and searches craigslist for postings. A .CSV is created with the postings.

I built this little craigslist scraper over spring break in 2019 to teach myself some Python and save time looking through craigslist.
In the process I learned about the HTML language by having to navigate the DOM tree with Beautiful soup.

Craigslist likely doesn't like their data being scraped(most websites don't) so I opensource this code for educational purposes. Using this script may result having your requests blocked by craigslist.
