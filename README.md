# Scraper-Project
A simple webscraping project using the beautifulSoup library in Python. FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY
___
I built this little craigslist scraper over spring break in 2019 to teach myself some Python and save time looking through craiglist.
In the process I learned about the HTML language by having to navigate the DOM tree with Beautiful soup.
